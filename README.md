OpenQCY Desktop is an open-source Windows controller for QCY earbuds. The first supported target is the **QCY MeloBuds N70 (HT18)**.

## Project status

OpenQCY Desktop now has a hardware-backed QCY MeloBuds N70 implementation. On August 3, 2026, the Windows app was validated against vendor ID `23877`, firmware `L 3.0.13 · R 3.0.13`:

- active BLE discovery through QCY manufacturer data (`0x521C`)
- connection to service `A001` and notification-based command responses
- real firmware and left/right/case battery readings
- automatic reconnect from the locally remembered control address, cached Windows GATT service, or the next N70 advertisement
- optional startup with Windows, running silently from the notification area until opened
- English desktop and notification-area interfaces
- state reads for ANC, game mode, sleep mode, LDAC, multipoint, wind detection, prompt volume, and auto power-off
- wear detection enabled and disabled from the desktop UI, followed by device readback
- a local profile that is reapplied when the N70 reconnects

Implemented daily controls:

- Left, right, and case battery state
- ANC, transparency, normal mode, and the five real N70 ANC scenes (adaptive, indoor, commuting, noisy, and anti-wind)
- EQ presets and a custom multi-band curve
- Touch gesture mapping
- Wear detection with automatic reapply on reconnect
- LDAC, multipoint, game mode, sleep mode, and wind-noise handling
- Prompt volume and auto power-off

The N70 firmware tested here exposes touch mappings directly and supports the parametric EQ command, but does not expose the legacy `0000000B` preset characteristic. OpenQCY therefore enables custom ten-band curves and only enables direct preset switching when that characteristic is actually available. Not every write path has yet been exercised on every N70 firmware variant; unsupported capabilities stay disabled instead of sending guessed commands.

Firmware flashing, account features, telemetry, ads, and store pages are explicitly out of scope.

**MeloBuds Pro / HT08 investigation:** the diagnostic Probe supports `--discovery-only`, with GATT enumeration and allowlisted standard reads. A physical MeloBuds Pro was identified on September 11, 2026 as vendor ID `19786` (`0x4D4A`), and its GATT topology was recorded. It exposes neither the standard Battery Service nor Device Information Service, so battery and firmware stay unknown. HT08 proprietary controls — reads included — remain disabled while the command protocol is unverified. See [safe discovery instructions and evidence requirements](docs/ht08-discovery.md).

## Technology

- C# 14 and .NET 10 LTS
- WinUI 3 / Windows App SDK
- Windows Bluetooth GATT APIs
- MVVM with CommunityToolkit.Mvvm
- Self-contained Windows 11 installer and portable distribution

The UI design language is called **OpenQCY Glass**: a Windows-native interpretation of the clarity, depth, large radii, and contextual expansion found in modern Apple interfaces. It uses native WinUI controls and original project assets; it does not ship Apple fonts, icons, or artwork.

## Build

Prerequisites:

- Windows 11
- .NET 10 SDK
- Inno Setup 6.7 or later (only when building the installer locally)

```powershell
dotnet restore -r win-x64
dotnet build -c Debug -p:Platform=x64 -p:RuntimeIdentifier=win-x64
dotnet run -c Debug -p:Platform=x64 -p:RuntimeIdentifier=win-x64
dotnet test tests/OpenQCY.Desktop.Tests.csproj -c Release
pwsh ./scripts/build-installer.ps1 -Version 0.2.0
```

The GitHub Actions pipeline builds both distributions. Pushing a semantic version tag such as `v0.2.0` publishes the installer, portable ZIP, and checksums to GitHub Releases. See the [release guide](docs/releasing.md), [Architecture](docs/architecture.md), [Protocol research](docs/protocol-research.md), and the [performance baseline](docs/performance.md).

## Safety

OpenQCY Desktop never guesses or brute-forces commands against connected earbuds. A command must have public interoperability evidence or a redacted capture from user-owned hardware, deterministic tests, and a readback/acknowledgement path before it is enabled. See the exact N70 evidence in [Protocol research](docs/protocol-research.md).
